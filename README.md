## D3 challenge

This webpage plots data using the [D3 library](https://d3js.org) for JavaScript.

The dataset is based on 2014 ACS one-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), as well as data from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm). It shows for each U.S. state: eaverage age and income, as well as what percent of the population are cigarette smokers, have obesity, live below the poverty level, and lack healthcare coverage.
